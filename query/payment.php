                        <p>We are dependent upon State records and may exhibit them on this website. While we continually attempt to make use of the latest information available, we cannot guarantee its accuracy, reliability, or timeliness.</p>
                        <h4 class="sub-heading"> CALENDAR REMINDERS</h4>
                        <p>As a significant segment of our services, we may offer reminders or notifications about upcoming and fast approaching deadlines that may apply to your trademark. These notifications are only for informational purposes and are the general standards applicable to most trademarks. It is advised that you consult a licensed attorney regarding applicable deadlines to your particular situation, as individualized situations have guidelines more specific than general ones. Please do not presume that the automated notifications are legal frameworks. We do not offer any form of legal advice or legal interpretation on specific situations.</p>
                        <h4 class="sub-heading">CREATION OF FORMS AND DISCLAIMER</h4>
                        <p>Please comprehend the distinction: We are a technology platform that aids in the creation of forms and not a law entity or legal service provider. In the event that you purchase one or more than one package that is inclusive of cease and desist, assignment of trademark letters, or other forms, you will be eligible to a form document that is inclusive of the information provided by you or from your uploaded files. We are not a legal alternative, making us ineligible for proving you with legal suggestions. Our customer service representatives are not required to answer any of your legal queries, nor will they entertain any law related conversations. Any information transmissions between yourself and our customer service representatives are not monitored and thus, you should refrain from sharing any confidential information with them. We provide assistance in the preparation of your trademark application but cannot file it for you as your counsel of record. We are not responsible for providing you with any legal advice related to your particular trademark.</p>
                        <p>We may voluntarily, but by no contractual binding are required to review the data you provide us with for completeness, fraudulence, or administrative errors. Under no specified instances are we responsible for reviewing your provided answers for legal accuracy, legal counsel, advice, or opinions. We do not review your data for any legal purposes, nor do we provide legal recommendations about legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection of forms, or strategies, or apply the law to the facts of your particular case.</p>
                        <p>In the event that you are under the assumption that you have received any legal assistance or consultancy from us, you will not make your purchase. You accept and understand that your purchase, download, or usage of a form document is not a legal action and is devoid of any legal advice. Additionally, you accept and understand that each form, and all applicable instructions or guiding texts are not designed to meet your individual needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>KINDLY NOTE THAT WE RETAIN YOUR CREDIT CARD DATA IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE STATE FILING FEE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ORDER. WE RETAIN YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION ONLY AFTER YOU ARE SATISFIED AND ABLE TO APPROVE THE APPLICATION, WITH THE COST OF THE FILING FEE BROUGHT INTO YOUR COGNIZANCE BEFORE BEING FILED.</strong></p>
                        <p>We provide you with a draft of the application for your review. If you do not respond with timeliness, you authorize us to sign your name to the application, file it as provided in the draft, and to collect from you the governmental filing fee of $350 per class at that time.</p>
                        <h4 class="sub-heading">SEARCH SERVICES</h4>
                        <p>If you utilize our search services, we use commercially and professionally reasonable methods to identify marks that may be tallied with the ones you seek to use. We, however, cannot guarantee that your mark will make it through and be approved even if you use our search services. There may be a number of reasons the USPTO rejects your mark and there are circumstances where an automated search may not be able to identify a mark the USPTO qualifies as a reason for rejection.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, when your order is inclusive of common law mark searches, we use commercially justifiable methods to identify marks that may be an equal match to the ones you seek to use. We, however, do not guarantee that your mark will be absent of or prevailing all claims or challenges made by holders of common law rights to all marks. There are amongst some of the instances where an automated search may not be able to identify a regular law mark that may be similar to your mark.</p>
                        <p>The aim of the search report is to give you with the necessary marks to satisfy the parameters identified for the specific kind of search you use. It is not designed to be a legal framework or legal advice as to whether your proposed mark will be dismissed, or whether it would be considered resembling to another mark. You may want to seek the counsel of an attorney regarding the outcomes of the search report we furnish you.</p>

                        <h4 class="sub-heading">Indemnity</h4>
                        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold blameless us, our officers, directors, representatives, employees, and agents and all of our parent companies, affiliates, related companies, merchants, and their executives, officers, directors, representatives, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, legal obligations, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (ii) your violation of any third party right, including without restriction any copyright, property, privacy right, or any and all incorporeal or intellectual property rights; or (iii) any claim that any of your UGC causes harm to a third party.</p>
                        <h4 class="sub-heading">Dispute Resolution</h4>
                        <p>For the purposes of this Section, all references to "Trademark Royalty," "you," and "us" are inclusive of our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, business partners, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us.</p>
                        <p>In this Agreement, Dispute is described as “any dispute, claim or controversy between you and Trademark Royalty, its members, officers, directors, agents, parent companies and vendors that arises out of or relates to this Agreement or use of the Site or Service, or otherwise regarding any aspect of your relationship with Trademark Royalty that has accrued or may thereafter accrue, whether based in contract, statute (including, but not limited to, any consumer protection statutes, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.”</p>
                        <p>The un-predictiveness of any Disputes is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state laws applicable to arbitrations. Regarding the substantive and significant law of any Disputes, to the optimal extent authorized by law, the laws of the State of California govern the non-arbitration related interpretation of this Agreement and the substantive law of any Dispute, notwithstanding of clashes of laws and principles.</p>
                        <p>Arbitration. Any Dispute shall be CONCLUSIVELY and EXCLUSIVELY solved by bonding individual arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1-16).</p>
                        <p>ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIM IS COMPULSORY AND IRREVOCABLE. NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT. IN ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE AAA CODE OF PROCEDURE.</p>
                        <p>All regulations as to the scope, interpretation, enforceability, applicableness, and validity of this Agreement shall be made final solely by the arbitrator, which award shall be contractually binding and final. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive: i) the termination of the Agreement; or ii) the bankruptcy of any party. If any portion of this arbitration provision is declared void, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining sections shall remain enforceable.</p>
                        <p>NO CLASS ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR JOINDER OR CONSOLIDATION OF ANY CLAIM WITH A CLAIM OF ANOTHER PERSON OR CLASS OF CLAIMANTS SHALL BE ALLOWABLE.</p>
                        <p>THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE E-MAILED TO Trademark Royalty, support@trademarkroyalty.com WITH THE SUBJECT LINE “OPT-OUT’ AND INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION.</p>
                        <p>Any arbitration will be administered by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less, its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes shall also be applicable. On disputes involving $75,000 or less, we will punctually reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. You agree to start arbitration only in your county of permanent residence or in California, US. We agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. Nothing herein restricts Trademark Royalty, from demanding the arbitrator to award Trademark Royalty, all costs of the arbitration including any Administrative Fees paid on your behalf.</p>
                        <p>If the Dispute is not arbitrated by the choice of the parties or a court does not compel arbitration if either party elects to arbitrate for whatever reason, the Dispute will be decided by a court without any right by either party to a trial by jury. Any such court proceeding, including any efforts to compel arbitration or initially filed lawsuits that arise out of or relate to this Agreement or use of the Sites shall be resolved exclusively by a court of proficient jurisdiction located within California.</p>
