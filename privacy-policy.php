While these records are publicly accessible for inspection, certain documents are kept confidential by both us and the USPTO under a secrecy agreement. Our trademark search services utilize the integrated USPTO database to search for identical or similar trademarks, allowing us to identify ownership rights, intellectual property rights, and other relevant trademark information held by other parties. If you need to make any changes to your data, we recommend directly updating the information with the USPTO, as these changes will automatically be reflected in our search services. For inquiries about available services, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@trademarkroyalty.com">support@trademarkroyalty.com</a> for a price quotation tailored to your desired service type.</p>

            <p>The information and details mentioned above are essential to be provided in order to accurately document comprehensive and complete information related to trademarking services offered by Trademark Royalty through our form and software program.
                In addition to the previously mentioned services, Trademark Royalty also utilizes universally trusted third-party services, such as Google API Services, YouTube API Services, Google Analytics Firebase, Sentry, and others. These services may collect personally identifiable information from you.
            </p>

            <p>Please note that personal information becomes public once the filing is completed and is disclosed by the regulatory office or federal government authority. In the case of the USPTO, the trademark owner's name and trademark details are made available to the public for review by other potential trademark owners or the general public. The USPTO also makes the names and mailing addresses of trademark owners public. State laws may require the publication of fictitious business names and the trademark owner's name and address in a newspaper. It is important to understand that this privacy policy is exclusive to Trademark Royalty and does not govern or cover the actions of government agencies or any third parties unaffiliated with Trademark Royalty.</p>

            <p>The demographic information along with traffic data is collected for improving the overall website for enhancing user experience. The generation of web analytics is also a critical part which shows the behavior and patterns of data of users and visitors that also help in the provision of a better website experience. The demographic data such as user’s area, unique IP visits, time of the visit and the frequent visit pages are part of the non-personal data and do not identify the users individually.</p>

            <p>On the contrary, personal data such as name, contact number and email address collected can be used for marketing purposes. If Trademark Royalty has exclusive offerings, or new products/services launched in the market, the company might make use of the following information to promote new products and services to our frequent and regular users. This does not include the financial/billing information of customers which is highly sensitive and is always kept confidential as per the company’s privacy policy. The data is used for processing only financial transactions for the services availed/purchased by the user. It is guaranteed by Trademark Royalty as per the privacy policy that this data will not be sold, rented or shared with any external third-party service not affiliated with Trademark Royalty in any manner, which might be harmful to you and compromise your sensitive information.</p>

            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

            <p>Trademark Royalty places keen perseverance on the confidentiality of user’s personally identifiable information which includes potentially vulnerable data which might lead to financial harm for the users. We fully understand the nature of data and thus, the confidentiality principle is given adequate weightage and careful consideration so that none of the data that might affect the user personally is compromised. Trademark Royalty will only disclose information that is given proper written consent by the user, and no data is made public without consent. Please note that if Trademark Royalty has the legal obligation by the federal court, state laws or legal authorities to publicize the data by means of a court order, search warrant, and subpoena, then we abide by the law to follow the legal authorities for certain orders.</p>

            <h4>Monitoring of Website Areas</h4>
            <p>Trademark Royalty offers a community as an interactive platform for the users to meet other trademark owners for sharing and discussing their experiences. This includes message boards, chat rooms, forums and threats. We do not exclusively supervise the information shared on the platform unless otherwise, it goes against the company’s policy and terms of usage. Please note that in case of the user intentionally or unintentionally sharing their personally identifiable information on any such platform which might cause harm to the individuality of the customer, Trademark Royalty shall not be held liable for any damages caused as a result of sharing this information. Therefore, it is highly recommended to not share any individualized information on such public platforms that might compromise your security and cause financial or reputation harm to you or your business altogether.</p>

            <h4>Record Maintenance</h4>
            <p>Trademark Royalty maintains the records of its trademark users for 11 years. The reason for retaining the data for 11 years is basically for trademark renewal purposes. In case of the trademark owner wants to renew their trademark after the expiry period of 10 years, or update the existing information, it is convenient for Trademark Royalty as all the basic information is already available with us rather than repeating the entire process again for renewal or updating purposes. Please note that the user also has the option to allow us to retain or remove the data as per their will. In case of removal, the customer is required to inform the Trademark Royalty specialist exclusively that they do not want the retention of data, thus removing it from our servers permanently.</p>

            <h4>Personal Information Update</h4>
            <p>Trademark Royalty offers users to manually update their personal information on the website using the ‘My Account’ section on the website. By signing in to the profile and visiting the edit profile section, the users have the option to review and update their information, while also allowing them to review and know the status update of their pending and processed trademark filing applications. The customers can also initiate a new order request with Trademark Royalty using their profile and account section.</p>

            <p>In any case, if the customer opts to have their personal information completely wiped off Trademark Royalty servers, and the USPTO website, the customer can choose the following ways to act upon;</p>

            <p> Contacting the trademark office or authority with whom your data is registered and made public. The user can put forward a request with the trademark authority to remove the data from their database, thus also removing the trademark information from the search library. If you are based in the USA, you can contact USPTO through the following link: <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/about/contacts/index.jsp">http://www.uspto.gov/about/contacts/index.jsp.</a> For this purpose, the customer can also contact us using the information on our contact us page: <a href="https://trademarkroyalty.com/contact-us">https://trademarkroyalty.com/contact-us</a> or write to us using the following email: support@trademarkroyalty.com to remove the trademark owner’s information from the registry.</p>

            <p> If you wish to have your data removed from the Trademark Royalty database, you can request us to either mask or delete your specific information from our publicly accessible database. To initiate this process, you need to submit a written request, which must include proof of ownership. The trademark owner should specify whether they want specific personal information masked or if they want the entire trademark page permanently deleted from trademarkroyalty.com.
