                            <h6>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</h6>
                             <p>The Limited Liability Company (LLC) is currently regarded as one of the most important corporate forms for smaller businesses for a variety of reasons. LLC compare to other organization is less expensive to form than others and it is also simpler to run.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Do C Corps and S Corps offer LLC to the individuals?</h6>
                            <p>The majority of the time, LLC is offered to business owners by C Corps and S Corps.</p>
                            <h6>Is the LLC accountable to federal income tax?</h6>
                           <p>LLC is exempt from federal income tax. The LLC is eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the income taxes paid by the firm are shown on each owner's tax return rather than at the level of the corporation.</p>

                            <h6>C-Corporation</h6>
                             <p>A C Corporation is recognized for being a corporate entity set up and organized at the federal level. One of the many methods to legally distinguish between the official and regulatory justification and the tax business. Comparing this corporation to other common business forms like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), S Corporations, Sole Proprietorships, and others, it is a unique way to create ownership of a company.
                            </p>
                           <h6>Why a C Corp is termed as a distinct legal entity?</h6>
                           <p>Some of the company's income may be distributed to shareholders as bonuses by the C Corporation. Due to the fact that a C Corp is a separate legal entity, the business obligations are distinct from those of the directors, investors, and shareholders.</p>

                             <p>There is nothing better than see your start-ups develop into established company over time. However, the tax rate also tends to increase as your business expands.
                            </p>
                           <h6>Why S- Corporation is convenient in the tax season?</h6>
                           <p>Rapidly growing businesses have several challenges throughout tax seasons. It is more urgent now that they must create a S Corporation. In terms of small firms, this entity proves to be quite useful to them throughout tax season.</p>

                             <p>Profit generation alone is not the only goal of a non-profit corporation. Like the LLC, S-Corp, and C-Corp, it operates differently. By sharing the profits with the employed people, this business's sole purpose is to help them. The stockholders receive no distribution of any kind.
                            </p>
                           <h6>Do Non-Profit Corporation pay the monthly wages of the employees?</h6>
