            </h4>
            <p>We may have affiliations with third-party websites that are not owned, controlled, or operated by us. We do not assume any responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these other websites or their owners.

            <h4>DISPLAY OF DATA AND SEARCH</h4>
            <p>We rely on state records and may display them on this website. Although we strive to use the most up-to-date information, we cannot guarantee its accuracy, reliability, or timeliness and do not take responsibility for the display of any inaccurate/incorrect information.</p>

            <h4>CALENDAR REMINDERS</h4>
            <p>As part of our services, we may provide reminders or notifications regarding upcoming deadlines that may pertain to your trademark. However, it is important to note that these notifications are for informational purposes only and are based on general standards applicable to most trademarks. It is highly recommended that you seek advice from a licensed attorney for deadlines specific to your individual situation, as each case may have unique guidelines. Please be aware that the automated notifications we provide do not constitute legal advice or legal interpretation for specific situations.</p>

            <h4>CREATION OF FORMS AND DISCLAIMER</h4>
            <p>Please understand that we are a technology platform that facilitates the creation of forms, but we are not a law firm or legal advisory provider. If you purchase a package that includes cease and desist letters, assignment of trademark letters, or other forms, you will receive a form document based on the information you provide or upload. However, please note that we are not a legal alternative and cannot provide legal advice. Our customer service representatives are not authorized to answer legal questions or engage in discussions related to the law. Any information exchanged between you and our customer service representatives is not monitored, so it is important not to share any confidential information with them. While we can assist you in preparing your trademark application, we cannot file it on your behalf or provide legal advice specific to your trademark. It is the sole responsibility of authorized and licensed US trademark attorneys and lawyers that are affiliated with us.</p>
            <p>We may choose to review the data you provide for completeness, fraudulence, or administrative errors, but we are not contractually obligated to do so. However, it is important to note that we do not review your answers for legal accuracy, or provide legal counsel, advice, or opinions. We do not undertake any legal review of your data or provide recommendations on legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, form selection, strategies, or the application of the law to your specific case.
                If you believe that you have received legal assistance or advice from us, you should refrain from making a purchase. It is important to acknowledge that purchasing, downloading, or using a form document does not constitute a legal action or provide legal advice. Furthermore, you understand that each form and accompanying instructions or guidance are not tailored to meet your specific requirements or circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT WE STORE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PAYING THE STATE FILING FEE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ORDER. WE ONLY RETAIN YOUR CREDIT CARD DATA AFTER YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE APPLICATION, AND WE INFORM YOU OF THE FILING FEE COST BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE FILING.
                We offer a draft of the application for your review. If you fail to respond within the specified timeframe, you give us the authorization to sign your name on the application, file it as presented in the draft, and collect the applicable government filing fee of $350 per class from you at that point.
            </p>

            <h4>SEARCH SERVICES</h4>
            <p>While utilizing our search services, we employ reasonable methods to identify marks that may correspond to the ones you intend to use. However, we cannot guarantee that your mark will be approved by the USPTO even if you utilize our search services. The USPTO may reject your mark for various reasons, and there may be instances where an automated search fails to identify a mark that the USPTO considers grounds for rejection. Additionally, when your order includes common law mark searches, we use justifiable methods to identify marks that may closely match the ones you intend to use. However, we do not guarantee that your mark will be free from any claims or challenges by holders of common law rights to similar marks. There are cases where an automated search may not identify a common law mark that resembles your mark.
                The purpose of the search report is to provide you with relevant marks that meet the criteria specified for the particular type of search you conduct. It is not intended to serve as a legal determination or advice on whether your proposed mark will be rejected or considered similar to another mark. If you require legal guidance regarding the results of the search report we provide, it is advisable to consult an attorney.
            </p>

            <p>In relation to the current release, you are hereby waiving California Civil Code Section 1542 (and any similar provision in other jurisdictions) which states: "A general release does not apply to claims that the creditor is not aware of or does not suspect to exist in their favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known, would have materially affected their settlement with the debtor."</p>

            <h4>INDEMNITY</h4>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our officers, directors, representatives, employees, and agents, as well as our parent companies, affiliates, related companies, merchants, and their executives, officers, directors, representatives, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debts, legal obligations, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your violation of any provision of these Terms of Service; (ii) your violation of any third-party rights, including but not limited to the copyright, property, privacy rights, or any other intellectual property rights; or (iii) any claim that your User Generated Content causes harm to a third party.</p>

            <h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
            <p>For the purposes of this section, the terms "Trademark Royalty," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, business partners, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any previous agreements between us.</p>
            <p>In this Agreement, the term "Dispute" refers to any disagreement, claim, or controversy between you and Trademark Royalty LLC, including its members, officers, directors, agents, parent companies, and vendors. This Dispute may arise from or be related to this Agreement, the use of the Site or Service, or any other aspect of your relationship with Trademark Royalty. It can encompass matters based on contract, statute (including consumer protection statutes), regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or other intentional torts), or any other legal or equitable theory.</p>
            <p>The resolution of any disputes is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not state laws related to arbitrations. As for the interpretation of this Agreement and the substantive law governing any Disputes, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the laws of the State of California govern, regardless of any conflicts of laws principles.</p>
            <p>Any Dispute must be conclusively and exclusively resolved through individual arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. This arbitration agreement is applicable to transactions involving interstate commerce and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1-16).</p>
            <p>ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIM IS MANDATORY AND CANNOT BE REVOKED. BOTH PARTIES ARE PROHIBITED FROM PURSUING THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT OF LAW. IN ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY HAS THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE AAA CODE OF PROCEDURE.</p>
            <p>The arbitrator has exclusive authority over all matters related to the extent, interpretation, enforceability, applicability, and validity of this Agreement. The arbitration award rendered by the arbitrator is binding and final, and it may be entered as a judgment in any court with jurisdiction. This arbitration provision will continue to be effective even if the Agreement is terminated or if any party declares bankruptcy. In the event that any part of this arbitration provision is deemed void, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining sections will still be enforceable.</p>
            <p>YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BRING A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE YOUR CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANOTHER PERSON OR CLASS OF CLAIMANTS. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT. TO OPT OUT, YOU NEED TO EMAIL TRADEMARK ROYALTY LLC AT <a href="mailto:support@trademarkroyalty.com">SUPPORT@TRADEMARKROYALTY.COM</a> WITH THE SUBJECT LINE "OPT-OUT" AND INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, AND A CLEAR STATEMENT EXPRESSING YOUR DESIRE NOT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration conducted under this agreement will be administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If the dispute has a value of $75,000 or less, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will also apply. For disputes involving $75,000 or less, we will promptly reimburse your filing fees and cover the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. You agree to initiate arbitration either in your county of permanent residence or in California, USA. We agree to initiate arbitration only in your county of residence. You have the option to request a telephonic or in-person hearing following the AAA rules. For disputes involving $10,000 or less, the hearing will generally be conducted by telephone unless the arbitrator determines there is a valid reason for an in-person hearing. The arbitrator has the authority to award the same damages to you individually as a court could. However, the arbitrator can only grant declaratory or injunctive relief to you individually if it is necessary to address your individual claim. This agreement does not prevent Trademark Royalty LLC from seeking reimbursement of all arbitration costs, including any administrative fees paid on your behalf.
                If the parties do not agree to arbitrate the dispute or if a court does not enforce arbitration despite a party's request, the dispute will be resolved through a court proceeding without the right to a trial by jury. Any court proceedings, including attempts to compel arbitration or initial lawsuits arising from or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Sites, will be exclusively resolved by a competent court located within California.
            </p>

            <h4>REFUND POLICY</h4>

We are committed to ensuring that every customer is completely satisfied with their filings. Our dedicated customer service team comprises friendly and knowledgeable trademark representatives who are focused on meeting the unique needs of each client.

However, please note that fees paid to Trademark Royalty, as well as any government-levied fees associated with your filing services, are non-refundable. It is important to understand that the USPTO's processing times or the denial of your application if it occurs, are factors beyond our control and will not be grounds for a refund because they are for a reason external to the company’s control.
                To be eligible for a refund, you must submit your request prior to the initiation of the initial trademark search clearance report. Refunds will be issued using the same payment method that was originally used. For instance, if you made the payment to Trademark Royalty LLC via credit card, the refund will be credited back to the same credit card. Alternatively, you have the option to request a credit that can be carried forward to future purchases/payments with Trademark Royalty LLC instead of receiving a refund.
